# Advent of Code 2020: Day 9

Finally the dreaded dynamic programming problem. But
realistically my difficulties in correctly reading the
problem description were a bigger time-sink, in spite of my
trying to be careful.

Also, I really wish the test instance wouldn't have
different parameters than the input instance: it is easy to
forget to switch between the two. Ideally, the instance
would just start with the window length.

This is *not* a decryption problem. I don't know why it is
labeled as one.
