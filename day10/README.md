# Advent of Code 2020: Day 10
Bart Massey

Hooray. Part 2 really was dynamic programming this time.  My
dumb bug there cost me some time.

I rewrote both parts to be much simpler and cleaner and
faster. See the branch `day10-orig` in this repo for the
original solutions.

Interesting problem. I'm not sure about these joltage
step-up adapters from 0 jolts. I'd like to see Kirchoff's
Joltage Law sometime.
