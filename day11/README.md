# Advent of Code 2020: Day 11
Bart Massey

---

Ugh. Mostly an exercise in debugging: not my proudest
moment. I really am amazed how bad I am at this kind of
coding.

At least I got to use Rust's `std::iter::from_fn()` for the
first time, which was interesting.

I shall check this code in as-is and never speak of it again.
