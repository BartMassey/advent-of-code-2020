# Advent of Code 2020: Day 13
Bart Massey

---

Part 1 was fun. I didn't think brute force would work for
the real input, but it did.

Part 2 was no fun. There are just so many ways to go wrong,
and this kind of problem is really hard to debug. It took
several hours to get all the way through it. Won't be doing
that too many more times before Christmas.
