# Advent of Code 2020: Day 16
Bart Massey

---

This is the kind of problem I hate. Parsing the input
properly took almost half an hour by itself. Solving Part 2
took me 2 hours. I foolishly assumed I needed a state-space
search, but chose poorly about the state space.

Turns out the input was rigged in a fashion not documented
anywhere in the problem statement.  This kind of baloney
"examine-the-input" analysis that comes out of the blue is
just no fun. You either spot it or you don't. If you don't
you're in for a bad time.

May be done with AoC for this year. We'll see tomorrow.
